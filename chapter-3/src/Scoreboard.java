/**
 * A Class for High Scores To maintain a sequence of high scores, we develop a
 * class named Scoreboard.
 * 
 * A scoreboard is limited to a certain number of high scores that can be saved;
 * once that limit is reached, a new score only qualifies for the scoreboard if
 * it is strictly higher than the lowest “high score” on the board.
 * 
 * The length of the desired scoreboard may depend on the game, perhaps 10, 50,
 * or 500. Since that limit may vary, we allow it to be specified as a parameter
 * to our Scoreboard constructor
